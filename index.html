                <h3>Assignment 1: Report</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>Assigement 1 was the starter task that really opened my eyes upon website development, it allowed me to look in depth into the details of websites and how well they fucntion. testing each website based on their performance</p>
                <p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> I would suggest to actually make the webstie testing done by students themselve testing on their own the performance instead of using automated tools that tests the speed and performance of the websits</p>
            </div>
            <div class="reflection">
                <h3>Assignment 2: Website</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>trying to build my first website was really an amazing experince being able to put my hands on the live tools that allows you to make your own website, I was able to understand the machnism and how different optiosn can be applied based on the website functionality. </p>
                <p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> I would suggest that if we were to be provided with more dynamic understanding with design principles or performance based concepts to have a dynamic mehcanism for the website. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="reflection">
                <h3>Assignment 3: GitHub E-portfolio</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>I have now deep understanding for how github works and I am very surprised with how the github actually works it is really a place where only developers and computer scince computers can only understand and even be able to reach their upload their protoflios.  .</p>
                <p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> amazing I have nothing to say. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="reflection">
                <h3>Project</h3>
                <p><strong>Summary:</strong>having such an experince at this early time of learning really excelerate the process of learning and puts everything together guided me through seeing the big picture connecting the dots of all the tools I have learned through out the semseter.  </p>
                <p><strong>Suggestions:</strong> to have it into phases which will then be monitored by the lecturer through out different phases making sure we get guidence on it</p>
